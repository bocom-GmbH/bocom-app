Title: Building an App with Quasar Framework and Cordova

Introduction:
In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of building a mobile application using the Quasar Framework and Cordova. A gentle reminder: it's advisable not to use lazy loads in the router for this setup.

Let's dive in:

Add Cordova Mode to Quasar:
Begin by adding Cordova mode to your Quasar project with the following command:

bash
Copy code
quasar mode add cordova
Navigate to src-cordova Directory:
Change your directory to src-cordova:

bash
Copy code
cd src-cordova
Create www Directory:
Create a new directory named www within src-cordova:

bash
Copy code
mkdir www
Add iOS Platform:
Now, add the iOS platform to your Cordova project:

bash
Copy code
cordova platform add ios
Check and Install Requirements:
Run the following command to check for and install any necessary requirements:

bash
Copy code
cordova requirements
If prompted, install the required packages.
Additional Dependency Installation:
Sometimes, you might need to run yarn install in the src-cordova folder:

bash
Copy code
yarn install
Add Necessary Cordova Plugins:
Add the Ionic WebView Cordova plugin:

bash
Copy code
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-ionic-webview
If needed, you can install the "save areas" plugin.
Build Your Quasar Project:
Build your Quasar project for Cordova:

bash
Copy code
quasar build -m cordova -T ios --ide
Configure in Xcode:
Once the build process completes, the rest of the configuration will be done in Xcode:

Click on your project's .xcodeproj file to open it in Xcode.
Select the target for your app, then set the signing with your bundle ID.
Set the iOS version you wish to target.
Remove iPad and macOS as target devices if not needed.
Edit the config.xml File:
In the config.xml file, add the following lines to enable scrolling on iOS:

xml
Copy code
<platform name="ios">
  <preference name="ScrollEnabled" value="true" />
</platform>
Your Quasar app is now configured and ready for further development and testing on iOS devices. Happy coding!
